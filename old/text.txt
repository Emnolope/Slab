The idea of hooking a smaller battery in parallel to big battery purely for unlocking reasons, then car is unstealable (they can't start the engine) and still unlocks wirelessly.

Buying used batteries from medical equipment, b/c they're gently treated.

LiFePO4 safer no thermal runaway
LiIon need BMS and thermocouple
LiIon easy to buy
LiIon high power density
LiFePO4 compatible with Lead Acid
LiIon can't take extreme temps
LiFePO4 can't take extreme temps
Short circuit kills
Need tab welding tool
Know proper wire laying.

I would like to be able to walk down the road without being scared for my life, or feeling terrified that people will see me being strange and then judge me, and then fear me, and then ostrasize me, and then try to kill me, because I act strange. And I want to be in a place where the people are free thinking people and progressive and they care about their community and they aren't ignorant and savage and backwards. Somewhere there aren't too many drug addicts. And I would like to be in a place where strange is accepted, but not because the people have gone insane or are on copious amounts of euphoric drugs. I would like to be very, very far from the drug trade, or at least somewhere it is managed sensibly. I would like to be around free thinkers and innovators and artists. more, I would like to be of use to this society. Even more, I would like the work I do to have a significant positive impact to those around me. Even more, I would like my work to have some long standing impact to the world. Even more, I would like to be somewhat well off, enough to have what I need and occasionally spend on strange things.

I have to make a VR World before I enter VR.
Why am I trying to create a VR world? BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T THEY WILL DRIVE YOU INSANE AND TAKE OVER YOUR MIND, AND TURN YOU INTO A GODLESS HEATHEN PERFORMING ABONINATIONS IN THE NAME OF LESSER GODS. And that's not even a joke.
All things considered what do you do?
Create a form of IDENTITY. (This can change)
Create a form of ENVIRONMENT. (This can change.)
Create a form of COMMUNITY. (This can change.)

And then use those specialized forms.

20230204 How to upgrade system, WHILE USING IT? Maybe old read only copy, while working on egg?

Mind space is now generative space
Physical space is now action space

Magic button, priority scheme problem

Problems need to be grouped together because there is a complex dependency relationship that might get lost in the plan to try to solve the problem.

Got rid of ID's You're expected to use search

Was trying to make a system that's position agnostic, WAY TOO HARD, MUST INCLUDE TOO MUCH METADATA (PARTS are position agnostic, other parts aren't)

It was getting ridiculously hard to keep track of what you actually need, amidst all the things things you now have, and all the things you now can do.

You had to separate the things that you actually needed, from the things that you could do on your free time.

The problem was due to a multilayered action structure. Something that doesn't seem important could be a prerequisite for something that is important. (A skateboard is a toy. But this toy can overcome a metabolic disorder. Power outlets are really important, but you don't need them anymore because you have the car, which can power an outlet.)

So we started trying to go back to the basics. Trying to form a way of doing a holistic health check to regenerate all potential problems. This was met with complete failure, as reality was too complicated to break down. So, instead we settled for addressing problems as they came along, in the present, and writing those problems down, so they could be solved optimally across multiple spaces.

This then led to the introduction of a problem/goal based approach, where everything is generated by either it's origin problem, or goal.

This was then merged into the present system, via a tag based approach allowing for a hybrid of the old todo/shop/build system with the current problem/goal system.






Okay but this new system should make it easy to input stuff wherever it's convenient.
Uhh maybe thing

Action space

Very important to make standardize form for all inputs. But also make that standardized form mixed with english.
Action space items can be represented by physical objects at their respective action spaces.
Gotta make something that holds all the datatypes:

CT1,CT2 Description of item    UIMX AC2,AC1 
 ID

Problems exist in physical space so their solutions exist in physical space
Goals exist in physical space space

20230128 There are generally two ways of finding problems, checking every pathway that's supposed to go right and correcting it. Checking everything that has gone wrong and reacting.

(Granted that our attention is never, strictly speaking, absolutely unmediated.) This yields a range of possibilities among the following categories: bodily, mediated attention; bodily, unmediated attention; mental, mediated attention; and mental, unmediated attention. Consider the following as ideal types in each case: the musician, the dancer, the scientist, and the philosopher."

Action of editing reality.
  MANY DIFFERENT WAYS to edit reality.
  Actions to do.
  Things to get.
  Forms to build.
  Ideas to develop.
  Processes to code.
  People to contact.
  The main thing here is that they all are editing reality accessible to the PRESENT.

Making it even more confusing is that lying a problem>solution goal<plan on top each other is a poggers combo.

Take all the items in the todo/shop/build list and render into problems goals procedures which are instantiations of the problems and goals. The idea is to make my problems more accessible.

(Summarize and shove this into SYSTEMS.)
Oh I was also supposed to take all the items in the hows and turn them into todo list, shop list, and build entries. AND What I noticed is my todo list and shopping list really is just a thrown together hodgepodge of stuff with no reguard to internal organization.

STAGE 1 random documents with project stuff everywhere, totally unusuable
STAGE 2 stuff gets centralized, organized, but hard to use.
STAGE 3 random documents everywhere in a standardized form, which information is extracted from to form holistic action book.

Problem is impetus to destroy form of reality with a solution.
Goal is impetus to create form of reality with a plan.
Problem exists in physical space(present total).
Goal exists in mind space(present total).
THIS ONE IS HUGE BECAUSE IT SAYS THAT PROBLEMS ARE THE ONLY THING ACTUALLY ROOTED IN REALITY.
Problem (definite form) grows upwards from the (ACTUAL NOT MIND SPACE BUT LITERAL)present.
Solution (indefinite form) grows downwards from the (present mind space project of the) future.
Goal (definite form) grows downwards from the (present mind space projection of the) future.
Plan (indefinite form) grows upwards from the (present mind space projection of the) present.

Problem is definite form.
Solution is indefinite form.
Goal is definite form.
Plan is indefinite form.

PROBLEM or GOAL is the IMPETUS to change the FORM OF REALITY. Goals and Problems are definite. (Present is only existence. Even if they project to future or past, the projections themselves are real.) Goals in future. Problems in present. Problems grow to future solutions grow backwards. Goals grow from future to plans grow forwards. There are many TRAJECTORIES between pairs. Each trajectory is a PROCEDURE. A procedure is made in (planning)mind space, and is executed in physical space and (action) mind space.

# DON'T
* DON'T clean unless you have a reason to. 
* DON'T clean up immediately after waking up, it's guilt based and you'll lose energy fast.
* DON'T clean up Internet tabs with the Internet on.
* DON'T try to force yourself to sleep and wake normally.
* DO identify positive cycles and write them on your arm
* DON'T buy all your groceries at once.
* DON'T EVER go to sleep cold or hungry, you'll be more tired by the time you wake up!
* DON'T pick your skin and nails, the cost is asymmetric!
* DON'T do anything physical while extremely tired, you're likely to break more than you create.
* DON'T try to fight the heat or cold directly, solve them first, THEN do what you're trying to do.
* DON'T just bear with sleeping uncomfortably, change the environment. It can wreck your sleep, which can enedanger your life.
* DON'T ask WHY in your moment of trial, instead ask HOW?
* DON'T shit every day, instead shit every other day. It controls your metabolism, and it's cleaner
* DON'T go on your computer first thing in the morning, stay IRL for 1 hour.
* DON'T fap when you know you need the energy for something later.
* DON'T look at pornography, it takes up too time and energy.
* DON'T heal naturally when you can augment yourself with artifical and external tools.
* DON'T leave things in a state of chaos.
* DON'T try to conserve items that are cheap and valuable, instead stockpile them.
* DON'T panic.
